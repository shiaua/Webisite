        <h2>Why I Decided to Do Web Depeveloping</h2>
        <!--adding paragraph explanation -->
        <p>
          During the pandemic, I lost interest in medicine and decided to walk a different path. Although I have left my interest in the medical field behind, my desire to help people and work in groups settings is still there! I always had interest in computers and decided to seek information on what was best for me! I then found Thinkful and Software Engineering! I hope to continue in learning and collaborating with people to grow into a better developer! 
        </p>
